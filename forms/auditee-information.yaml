explanatory_text:
  heading: The unique entity identifier used by the FAC has changed.
  explanation: On April 4, 2022, the unique entity identifier used across the federal government changed from the DUNS Number to the Unique Entity ID (generated by SAM.gov).
  gloss:
    - The Unique Entity ID is a 12-character alphanumeric ID assigned to an entity by SAM.gov.
    - As part of this transition, the DUNS Number has been removed.
    - Entity registration, searching, and data entry in the FAC now require use of the new Unique Entity ID.
  subheading: What is a UEI?
  more: For more information about this transition, visit SAM.gov or the Federal Service Desk, FSD.gov. You can search for help at FSD any time or request help from an FSD agent Monday–Friday 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. ET.
